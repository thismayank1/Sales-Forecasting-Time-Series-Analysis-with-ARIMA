# Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis (ARIMA)

## Project Overview
This project involves predicting future sales based on historical data using time series forecasting techniques. The ARIMA model is applied to analyze trends and make sales predictions. Interactive visualizations are implemented using Plotly.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels (ARIMA Model)
- Plotly

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Time Series Analysis
- ARIMA Model for Forecasting
- Dynamic Visualization with Plotly

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thismayank1/Sales-Forecasting-Time-Series-Analysis-with-ARIMA.git
   cd Sales-Forecasting-Time-Series-Analysis-with-ARIMA
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Sales_Forecasting.py
   ```

## Output
- The script generates a time series forecast of sales.
- The forecast results are stored in `Sales_Forecast.csv`.
- A Plotly visualization displays actual vs predicted sales trends.

## Future Improvements
- Tune ARIMA hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Implement Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL) analysis.
- Explore alternative forecasting models like Prophet or LSTM.
